⚠️  SHADOW TRADE REVIEW - PSYCHOLOGICAL GUARDRAIL ⚠️
================================================================================

DO NOT REVIEW SHADOW TRADE PERFORMANCE UNTIL:

✅ 50 REAL TRADES HAVE BEEN COMPLETED
✅ v1.0 EVALUATION IS FINISHED
✅ You have documented v1.0 results

================================================================================

WHY THIS RULE EXISTS:

Shadow trades will APPEAR to outperform real trades over small samples (10-20).
This is NORMAL variance, not evidence that filters are wrong.

If you review shadow performance too early:
❌ You will experience regret bias
❌ You will remove filters prematurely  
❌ Performance will collapse in live trading
❌ You will conclude "the system stopped working"

The system didn't stop working.
You stopped following your own rules.

================================================================================

WHAT SHADOW TRADES ARE FOR:

After 50+ real trades, shadow trades help answer:

✅ "How many trades did SMT block that would have won?"
✅ "Are late reclaims actually bad, or just noisy?"
✅ "Is ISI filtering edge or just reducing frequency?"
✅ "Which filter has the highest opportunity cost?"

You don't remove filters because shadows look good.
You remove filters because they demonstrably destroy expectancy.

================================================================================

THE DISCIPLINE:

1. Trade v1.0 for 50 real trades with ZERO modifications
2. After 50 trades, analyze both real AND shadow performance
3. Compare expectancy (not just win rate or single metrics)
4. Make evidence-based decisions about filter modifications
5. Test modifications in v1.5 (not v1.0)

================================================================================

REMEMBER:

Your goal is not to maximize theoretical backtest performance.
Your goal is to build a system you can TRUST and FOLLOW.

If you break this rule, you break trust.
If you break trust, you cannot follow the system.
If you cannot follow the system, it doesn't matter how good it is.

TAPE IT TO YOUR MONITOR.
READ IT WHEN YOU'RE TEMPTED TO "JUST CHECK" SHADOW PERFORMANCE.
